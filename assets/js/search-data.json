I’m mostly interested in processing morphologically-rich low-resource languages, first-language acquisition and how to use linguistic knowledge to improve models, methodologies and applications (“just use more data” is never the answer). . Always happy to chat, you can find me on Twitter, Linkedin or Github . Moving on up",
