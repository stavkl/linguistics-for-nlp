The task: Part-of-speech Tagging The language: Hebrew The data: The Hebrew treebank The means: fine-tuning Multilingual BERT . The challenge(s) with POS-tagging in Hebrew . This section only deals with the challenges in POS-tagging Hebrew, and in another post I’ll review the challenges of processing languages with non-concatenative morphology in general. In NLP, a word is a space-delimited sequence of characters. Each word is composed of at least one morpheme. A morpheme is the smallest unit of meaning, and it comes in two shapes: bound and free. A bound morpheme has to be part of a word, like the English plural suffix -s, while a free morpheme can stand on its own, like the coordinator and. The main difference between English and Hebrew in this sense is that Hebrew has a much higher morphemes-to-word ratio than English, so for example the sequence and when I saw (4 free morphemes in English) is expressed in Hebrew using a single word - וכשראיתי /ve-kshe-raiti/ (and - bound, when - bound, saw.1st per.sg - free). Each morpheme in the Hebrew word has a different POS tag, which one should we choose? Easy, we don’t, we take them all (otherwise we loose valuable syntactic information that we do encode for English) - Introducing the multitag, which is a POS-tag composed of POS-tags. In the example the multitag would be CONJ^REL ^VB with the ‘^’ indicating the correct order. This is absolutely crucial for the analysis of Hebrew, which has many bound morphemes that carry their own POS-tag. . Trivia break! . What is the single concept/meaning that its relevant morpheme is bound in English and free in Hebrew? Really, this happens only once. Hint in the comments. .",
