This post will review the paper I presented at SIGMORPHON this year (see link in the publications section), that should have been presented at ISCOL too but eventually didn’t. Fortunately though, a blog post is more interactive, fun, and free-style than a paper, poster or an 8-min presentation and definitely my favorite medium. . The task: Part-of-speech Tagging .

I’m mostly interested in processing morphologically-rich low-resource languages, first-language acquisition and how to use linguistic knowledge to improve models, methodologies and applications (“just use more data” is never the answer). .
