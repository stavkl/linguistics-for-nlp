&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-adequate-are-word-pieces-for-modelling-complex-morphology&quot;&gt;How adequate are word-pieces for modelling complex morphology?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;tldr;&lt;/strong&gt; 
not at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The task: Part-of-speech Tagging&lt;br /&gt;
The language: Hebrew&lt;br /&gt;
The data: &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/OnlpLab/Hebrew_UD&quot;&gt;The Hebrew treebank&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The means: fine-tuning Multilingual BERT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-challenges-with-pos-tagging-in-hebrew&quot;&gt;The challenge(s) with POS-tagging in Hebrew&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section only deals with the challenges in POS-tagging Hebrew, and in another post I’ll review the challenges of processing languages with non-concatenative morphology in general.
In NLP, a word is a space-delimited sequence of characters. Each word is composed of at least one &lt;strong&gt;morpheme&lt;/strong&gt;. A morpheme is the smallest unit of meaning, and it comes in two shapes: bound and free. A bound morpheme has to be part of a word, like the English plural suffix &lt;em&gt;-s&lt;/em&gt;, while a free morpheme can stand on its own, like the coordinator &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt;. 
The main difference between English and Hebrew in this sense is that Hebrew has a much higher morphemes-to-word ratio than English, so for example the sequence &lt;em&gt;and when I saw&lt;/em&gt; (4 free morphemes in English) is expressed in Hebrew using a single word - וכשראיתי /ve-kshe-raiti/ (and - bound, when - bound, saw.1st per.sg - free). Each morpheme in the Hebrew word has a different POS tag, which one should we choose? Easy, we don’t, we take them all (otherwise we loose valuable syntactic information that we do encode for English) - Introducing the &lt;strong&gt;multitag&lt;/strong&gt;, which is a POS-tag composed of POS-tags. In the example the multitag would be CONJ^REL\^VB with the ‘^’ indicating the correct order.
This is absolutely crucial for the analysis of Hebrew, which has many bound morphemes that carry their own POS-tag.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;trivia-break&quot;&gt;Trivia break!&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is the &lt;strong&gt;single&lt;/strong&gt; concept/meaning that its relevant morpheme is &lt;strong&gt;bound in English&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;free in Hebrew&lt;/strong&gt;? Really, this happens only once. Hint in the comments.&lt;/p&gt;
