## Hi :)
My name is Stav Klein. 
I'm studying towards an MA in Linguistics (Tel-Aviv University) while doing some cool stuff with NLP. I'm mostly interested in processing morphologically-rich low-resource languages, first-language acquisition and how to use linguistic knowledge to improve models, methodologies and applications ("just use more data" is never the answer).

Always happy to chat, you can find me on <a href="https://twitter.com/stavkl">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/stav-klein-105736135/">Linkedin</a> or <a href="https://github.com/stavkl">Github</a>
