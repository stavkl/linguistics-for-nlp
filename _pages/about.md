## Hi :)
My name is Stav Klein. 
I'm studying towards an MA in Linguistics (Tel-Aviv University), and I'm also very interested in deep learning for NLP and especially in processing morphologically-complex and low-resource languages, first-language acquisition and how to use linguistic knowledge to improve models, methodologies and applications ("just use more data" is never the right answer).

Always happy to chat, you can find me on <a href="https://twitter.com/stavkl" target="_blank">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/stav-klein-105736135/" target="_blank">Linkedin</a> or <a href="https://github.com/stavkl" target="_blank">Github</a>
